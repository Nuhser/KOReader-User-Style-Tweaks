# KOReader User Style Tweaks Collection

This is a collection of multiple user style tweaks that can be used in KOReader to format E-books.

Each style tweak is contained in a separate `CSS`-file. To add a style tweak, copy it to `koreader/styletweaks/` and restart KOReader. You can find more information [here](https://koreader.rocks/user_guide/#L2-styletweaks).

Further information for each style tweak can be found in a comment at the beginning of the file.
